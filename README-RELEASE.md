# How to publish the xPack OpenOCD

## Build

Before starting the build, perform some checks.

### Check possible open issues

Check GitHub [issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/issues)
and fix them; do not close them yet.

### Check the `CHANGELOG.md` file

Open the `CHANGELOG.md` file and and check if all
new entries are in.

Generally, apart from packing, there should be no local changes compared
to the original OpenOCD distribution.

Note: if you missed to update the `CHANGELOG.md` before starting the build,
edit the file and rerun the build, it should take only a few minutes to
recreate the archives with the correct file.

### Check the version

The `VERSION` file should refer to the actual release.

### Push the build script

In this Git repo:

- if necessary, merge the `xpack-develop` branch into `xpack`.
- push it to GitHub.
- possibly push the helper project too.

### Clean the destination folder

Clear the folder where the binaries from all build machines will be collected.

```console
$ rm -f ~/Downloads/xpack-binaries/openocd/*
```

### Run the build scripts

When everything is ready, follow the instructions in the
[build](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/blob/xpack/README-BUILD.md)
page.

## Test

Install the binaries on all supported platforms and check if they are
functional, using the Eclipse STM32F4DISCOVERY blinky test
available in the xpack-arm-none-eabi-gcc package, which uses
the `-f "board/stm32f4discovery.cfg"` configuration file
(import the `arm-f4b-fs` project and start the `arm-f4b-fs-debug-oocd` 
launcher).

For platforms where Eclipse is not yet available (like Arm), simply start the
program and check if the CPU is identified.

If this is the first time openocd is executed, on GNU/Linux it is necessary
to configure the rights, otherwise LIBUSB will issue the _libusb_open
failed: LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS_ error.

```
sudo cp ~Downloads/xpack-openocd-0.10.0-15/contrib/60-openocd.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Than it is possible to start openocd:

```
$ .../xpack-openocd-0.10.0-15/bin/openocd -f "board/stm32f4discovery.cfg"

Note: on recent macOS systems it might be necessary to allow individual

## Publish the binaries as pre-release/test

Use the [test pre-release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/pre-releases/releases/tag/test)
to publish the binaries, for other to test them.

## Run the pre-release Travis tests

In the `tests/scripts/trigger-travis-*.sh` files, check and update the
URL to use something like

```
base_url="https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/pre-releases/releases/download/test/"
```

Trigger the stable and latest Travis builds (on a Mac by double-clicking 
on the command scripts):

- `tests/scripts/trigger-travis-stable.mac.command
- `tests/scripts/trigger-travis-latest.mac.command

## Create a new GitHub pre-release

- go to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases) page
- click the **Draft a new release** button
- name the tag like **v0.10.0-15** (mind the dash in the middle!)
- select the `xpack` branch
- name the release like **xPack OpenOCD v0.10.0-15** (mind the dash)
- as description
  - add a downloads badge like `![Github Releases (by Release)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/v0.10.0-15/total.svg)`
  - draft a short paragraph explaining what are the main changes
- **attach binaries** and SHA (drag and drop from the archives folder will do it)
- **enable** the **pre-release** button
- click the **Publish Release** button

Note: at this moment the system should send a notification to all clients watching this project.

## Run the release Travis tests

Using the scripts in `tests/scripts/`, start:

- trigger-travis-quick.mac.command (optional)
- trigger-travis-stable.mac.command
- trigger-travis-latest.mac.command

The test results are available from:

- https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack

For more details, see `tests/scripts/README.md`.

## Prepare a new blog post

In the `xpack.github.io` web Git:

- select the `xpack-develop` branch
- add a new file to `_posts/openocd/releases`
- name the file like `2020-10-13-openocd-v0-10-0-15-released.md`
- name the post like: **xPack OpenOCD v0.10.0-15 released**.
- as `download_url` use the tagged URL like `https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases/tag/v0.10.0-15/`
- update the `date:` field with the current date

If any, close
[build issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/issues)
on the way. Refer to them as:

- **[Issue:\[#1\]\(...\)]**.

## Update the SHA sums

Copy/paste the build report at the end of the post as:

```console

## Checksums
The SHA-256 hashes for the files are:

```

If you missed this, `cat` the content of the `.sha` files:

```console
$ cd ~Downloads/xpack-binaries/openocd
$ cat *.sha
```

## Update the Web

- in the `develop` branch
- commit the `xpack.github.io` project; use a message
  like **xPack OpenOCD v0.10.0-15 released**
- wait for the GitHub Pages build to complete
- the result is in https://xpack.github.io/web-preview/news/

## Publish on the npmjs server

- select the `xpack-develop` branch
- open [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases)
  and select the latest release
- check the download counter, it should match the number of tests
- update the `baseUrl:` with the file URLs (including the tag/version); 
no terminating `/` is required
- from the web release, copy the SHA & file names
- commit all changes, use a message like
  `package.json: update urls for 0.10.0-15 release` (without `v`)
- update `CHANGELOG.md`; commit with a message like
  _CHANGELOG: prepare npm v0.10.0-15.1_
- `npm version 0.10.0-15.1`; the first 4 numbers are the same as the
  GitHub release; the fifth number is the npm specific version
- `npm pack` and check the content of the archive, which should list
only the `package.json`, the `README.md`, `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md`
- merge `xpack-develop` into `xpack`
- push all changes to GitHub
- `npm publish --tag next` (use `--access public` when publishing for the first time)

## Test if the npm binaries can be installed with xpm

Run the `tests/scripts/trigger-travis-xpm-install.sh` file, this
will install the package on Intel Linux 64-bit, macOS and Windows 64-bit.

For 32-bit Windows, 32-bit Intel GNU/Linux and 32-bit Arm, install manually.

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@next
```

## Promote next to latest

Promote the release as `latest`:

- `npm dist-tag ls @xpack-dev-tools/openocd`
- `npm dist-tag add @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@0.10.0-15.1 latest`
- `npm dist-tag ls @xpack-dev-tools/openocd`

## Update the Web

- in the `master` branch, merge the `develop` branch
- wait for the GitHub Pages build to complete
- the result is in https://xpack.github.io/news/
- remember the post URL, since it must be updated in the release page

## Create the final GitHub release

- go to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases) page
- check the download counter, it should match the number of tests
- add a link to the Web page `[Continue reading »]()`; use an same blog URL
- **disable** the **pre-release** button
- click the **Update Release** button

## Share on Twitter

- in a separate browser windows, open [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/)
- using the `@xpack_project` account
- paste the release name like **xPack OpenOCD v0.10.0-15 released**
- paste the link to the blog release URL
- click the **Tweet** button
